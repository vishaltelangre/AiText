# Privacy Policy

Last updated: April 6, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how AiText ("we", "our", or "the extension") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our browser extension.

## Information We Collect

### User-Selected Text Content

- The extension only processes text that you explicitly select and choose to analyze using the context menu options.
- This selected text is temporarily processed in memory and is only sent to the AI provider you've configured (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, or DeepSeek).
- We do not store, retain, or collect any of the text content you process through the extension.

### User Settings

- API Keys: The extension stores your AI provider API keys locally in your browser's storage. These keys are never transmitted to our servers or any third party other than the respective AI provider when making API calls.
- Custom Actions: Any custom AI actions you create are stored locally in your browser's storage.
- Preferences: Your selected AI provider and other settings are stored locally in your browser's storage.

## How We Use Your Information

### Text Processing

- Selected text is only used to generate AI responses through your chosen AI provider.
- Text content is transmitted directly from your browser to the AI provider's servers using their official APIs.
- We do not maintain any servers that store or process your text content.

### API Keys and Settings

- API keys and settings are used solely to authenticate with your chosen AI provider and customize your extension experience.
- This information remains in your local browser storage and is not transmitted elsewhere.

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage

- All user settings, including API keys and custom actions, are stored locally using browser.storage.sync.
- This data never leaves your browser except for API keys which are only sent to their respective AI providers for authentication.

### Transmission Security

- All communication with AI providers is done over secure HTTPS connections.
- We do not intercept, store, or log any of these communications.

When you use these services:
